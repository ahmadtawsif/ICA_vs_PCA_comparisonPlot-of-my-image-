# ICA_vs_PCA_comparisonPlot-of-my-image-
HERE I HAVE USED AN IMAGE TO FIGURE OUT THE PERFORMANCE OF ICA AND PCA. FIRST IMAGE IS UPLOADED. THEN IT WAS CROPPED TO CERTAIN DIMENSION WHICH LOOKS LIKE A HORIZONTAL PATTERN.
AFTER CROPPING, I INCLUDED MIXING MATRIX WITH IT, BY GENERATING RANDOM MATRIX. IT LOOKS LIKE COMBINATION OF SOME VERTICAL PATTERN.
LATER, I TRIED TO GET THE SOURCE IMAGE BY ICA AND PCA.
WITH ICA WE CAN SEE THAT A HORIZONTAL PATTERN WITH CHECKERBOARD PATTERN  HAS CONSTRUCTED BUT STILL IT IS FAR WAY FROM THE ORIGINAL.
ON THE OTHER HAND IN PCA NOTHING MUCH IMPROVED NO SIMILAR PATTERN HAS GENERATED.
IF WE SEE THE PLOT WITH INTENSITY OF THE PIXELS, WE SEE IN ICA PIXEL VALUES ARE CLOSE TO THE ORIGINAL IMAGE STILL IT IS NOT SIMILAR.
ON THE OTHER HAND IN PCA THE PIXEL VALUES DIFFER TOO MUCH THAN THE ORIGINAL IMAGE.
